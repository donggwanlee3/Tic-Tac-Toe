# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in React

Welcome to my personal project showcasing the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React. This project highlights my understanding and application of fundamental React concepts including components, props, state management, and event handling. It also includes advanced features like time travel and move sorting to enhance the gameplay experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Click on the squares to play X and O alternately.
- **Winner Indication:** Displays the winner once a player wins the game.
- **Game History:** Records the history of moves and allows players to review and jump to any previous move.

## Usage

- Click on any square to place your mark (X or O).
- The game will display the current player and indicate the winner when the game is won.
- Use the move list to jump to any previous move.
- Toggle the sorting order of moves using the "Sort Moves" button.

## Game Logic

The game logic for determining the winner is implemented in the `calculateWinner` function. It checks all possible winning combinations and returns the winner if found.

```javascript
function calculateWinner(squares) {
  const lines = [
    [0, 1, 2],
    [3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8],
    [0, 3, 6],
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [0, 4, 8],
    [2, 4, 6],
  ];
  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    const [a, b, c] = lines[i];
    if (squares[a] && squares[a] === squares[b] && squares[a] === squares[c]) {
      return squares[a];
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

## Code Structure

- **`App.js`**: The main component that renders the game.
- **`Square.js`**: The Square component that represents each square on the board.
- **`Board.js`**: The Board component that renders the grid of squares.
- **`Game.js`**: The Game component that manages the state and logic of the game.

## Future Enhancements

- **Highlight Winning Squares:** Add functionality to highlight the squares that form the winning combination.
- **Enhanced Styling:** Improve the overall design and user interface.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure the game is fully responsive and playable on mobile devices.
